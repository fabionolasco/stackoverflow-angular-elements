# POC on how to combine Angular Elements and "ng g library"

## About

The Angular CLI command "ng g library" is used to help us get started with the creation of a new library. In this library, we can create multiple UI components that can be re-used by various projects. On the other hand, Angular Elements is the Angular solution to assist us to create Web Components. So, the question is: Would it be possible to combine both?

## Technologies used

- `Angular`
- `Angular CLI`
